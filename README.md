# nba-trade-sim
Very bad code, non-functional, very much in development, but is supposed to be improvement upon ESPN's NBA Trade Simulator.  

TODO:  
* Make it look pretty
  * Update HTML code
  * Add CSS file?
* Condense everything in Value.java (Use loops and arrays?)
* Data stuff
  * Automate scraping script, currently Perl, maybe use BeautifulSoup or something in R
  * Use mySQL for database management
